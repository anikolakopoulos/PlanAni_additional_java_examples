PlanAni is a program animator based on the idea of roles of
variables. A role describes the dynamic character of a variable
embodied by the sequence of its successive values as related to other
variables and external events. In PlanAni, variables are represented
by role images, e.g., each fixed value is represented by a stone
giving the impression of something that is hard to change. Moreover,
operations like assignment and comparisons have role-specific
animations.

PlanAni assumes that you have Tcl/Tk installed. To run PlanAni in
UNIX/Linux, give the command

        > planani

In windows, start Tcl/Tk, load the file start.tcl, and start it.

The file help.txt contains a short user guide for end users of
PlanAni (i.e., students), the file userGuide contains instructions
for authoring new animations, the file API describes how animation
commands work, and the directory man/mann contains manual pages for
API commands.
